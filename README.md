# Simple-CPU
The main purpose of this project is to get into dealing with more complex designs, and become familiar with some of the elements used within a CPU.\

The microcontroller designed in this assignment is a simplified version of a CPU. Specifically, four simplifications are considered as follows:\
1)	No off-chip memory: The instructions of the program are assumed to be in the  memory.\
2)	The programs consist of valid instructions ONLY, i.e., you do not have to perform error checking to detect bad instructions\
3)	No overflow detection is required.\
4)	The CPU has a synchronous reset rst. That resets all registers to zero.
